			What is Gender Equality?
			</h2>
			<p id ="gq">	"Gender Equality" is an important issue for both men and women and should be followed by every members in the society. Others believe that all women's duty is to just stay in their homes, do household             chores and take care of their family while men will apply for a job and earn money but others believe that it should not be the case. Women should also have the freedom to do what they want in                    contributing for the development of the society.  Women should not be prevented in achieving their personal ambitions and they should have the equal access of rights and power with men. Gender Equality       should and must be given to every human being regardless of their race, religion, and sexuality. <br><br>

                We continue to believe in the traditonal belief of the difference between masculine and feminine that is why women are forced to follow these norms preventing them from achieving the oppurtunities that will come ahead. Dicrimination and violence are the causes of gender inequality that is why it is an important issue that must be solved.<br><br>

                There are a lot of programs already developed to support Gender Equality, aiming to stop the discrimination taking place for both genders in a society. Promoting and applying the concept of gender equality maybe one of the best solution that we can do in closing the gender gap in every country. Due to the growing popularity of social media, women are already given the voice to speak and fight for their rights. Back then, women are believed that they cannot achieve what men can but in reality they are just locking the potential of women to prove for themselves. In the Philippines there is a law mandated, "The Magna Carta of Women", that protects and recognizes the rights of every filipino women.<br><br>

                Both genders should equally work together in finding solutions to every problem. We all have different strengths and capabilites and no one should be discriminated. If women are given the rights to do what men can also do, then it is a step in attaining gender equality. Men should support women not to degrade them and women should also do the same. Everyone should just believe in one another and inequality will be prevented and maybe forgotten.  <br><br>

                We should not live in a society were we think that women are weak compared to men. We should be equal to one another and accept each others differences because every human being is unique regardless of their sexuality.
