"In my experience there are a lot of times when I am being respected of my decisions and my actions just for example when I took up this IT course my family and the people around me did not stop me from my decision because there are some people who think that the IT course is mostly for men. In my opinion, we should just respect each others decision in life. Men and women both have the ability to do things in their own we just need to trust them."

"I think Gender Equality is very much applied in our country, if we will compare it with other countries wherein men are really the superiors and women are always behind. But I am not saying that it is always the men, ofcourse there are also some instances where men are being abused. That is why it is a problem that must be solved not only for those that are affected by this inequality but also the whole society. We need to realize it's importance, and consider its bad effect on the children who is still innocent about this things."
