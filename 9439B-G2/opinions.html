			<p id="opinion1"> I always encounter differences between males and females. Just by inserting our cultures from our daily lives. It shows how inequal we are from each other. This opinion may a trigger a lot of people and this opinion may be biased because its my own experience on what is really happening. And i know that i can only give an opinion that is based on my personal experiences and not about nonsense creative narrative, magical imagation of writing an opinion just to show a point. Based on what I've seen and observed this world had enough. we been asking to have something even though we already have it and yet we keep asking something we don't have and asking for something will never end. this applies on both men and women. What we really need to do is to embrace what we have and use it in wisely if we keep complaining that nothing good will happen. </p> <br>
