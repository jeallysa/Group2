				<p > "I always encounter differences between males and females. Just by inserting our cultures from our daily lives. It shows how inequal we are from each other. This opinion may a trigger a lot of people and this opinion may be biased because its my own experience on what is really happening. And i know that i can only give an opinion that is based on my personal experiences and not about nonsense creative narrative, magical imagation of writing an opinion just to show a point. Based on what I've seen and observed this world had enough. we been asking to have something even though we already have it and yet we keep asking something we don't have and asking for something will never end. this applies on both men and women. What we really need to do is to embrace what we have and use it in wisely if we keep complaining that nothing good will happen."<br><i>-Anonymous</i> </p>

				<p >"In my experience there are a lot of times when I am being respected of my decisions and my actions just for example when I took up this IT course my family and the people around me did not stop me from my decision because there are some people who think that the IT course is mostly for men. In my opinion, we should just respect each others decision in life. Men and women both have the ability to do things in their own we just need to trust them." <br><i>-Anonymous</i></p>

				<p >"I think Gender Equality is very much applied in our country, if we will compare it with other countries wherein men are really the superiors and women are always behind. But I am not saying that it is always the men, ofcourse there are also some instances where men are being abused. That is why it is a problem that must be solved not only for those that are affected by this inequality but also the whole society. We need to realize it's importance, and consider its bad effect on the children who is still innocent about this things."<br><i>-Anonymous</i></p>

				<p >"I really like the sense of Gender Equality because I want women to be treated equally as men because they deserve it. Over the years, they have proven that they can stand in their own feet and showed that they can be independent. Even a single mother can raise all her children on her own, thats how strong they are. I dont want women to feel that they are being deprived of the chance of progressing, that they would feel like man will be always far more superior than them, because every women are as capable men."<br><i>-Anonymous</i></p>

                <p>In our country, I've already seen some that gender equality is being applied. In the past, women are considered weaker than men, so women stay inside the house for household chores while men go out to find living. But now, even driving a jeep, or working in the construction site or anything what men can do is also
                also possible for women to work. <br><i>- Anonymous</i>

                <p>We know that gender equality must be really apply in every country, so Philippines signed a law to guarantee the equality of men and women, The Magna Carta on Women (Republic Act 9710) one of the reason is for the protection of Filipina women from all forms of violence or should we say that it is mostly focused on women, but not all women is a victim of crime/violence. so they must also consider others. <br><i>- Anonymous</i>
