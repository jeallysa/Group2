			<p id="opinion1"> "I always encounter differences between males and females. Just by inserting our cultures from our daily lives. It shows how inequal we are from each other. This opinion may a trigger a lot of people and this opinion may be biased because its my own experience on what is really happening. And i know that i can only give an opinion that is based on my personal experiences and not about nonsense creative narrative, magical imagation of writing an opinion just to show a point. Based on what I've seen and observed this world had enough. we been asking to have something even though we already have it and yet we keep asking something we don't have and asking for something will never end. this applies on both men and women. What we really need to do is to embrace what we have and use it in wisely if we keep complaining that nothing good will happen."<br><i>-Anonymous</i> </p>

            <p id="opinion2">"In my experience there are a lot of times when I am being respected of my decisions and my actions just for example when I took up this IT course my family and the people around me did not stop me from my decision because there are some people who think that the IT course is mostly for men. In my opinion, we should just respect each others decision in life. Men and women both have the ability to do things in their own we just need to trust them." <br><i>-Anonymous</i></p>

            <p id="opinion3">"I think Gender Equality is very much applied in our country, if we will compare it with other countries wherein men are really the superiors and women are always behind. But I am not saying that it is always the men, ofcourse there are also some instances where men are being abused. That is why it is a problem that must be solved not only for those that are affected by this inequality but also the whole society. We need to realize it's importance, and consider its bad effect on the children who is still innocent about this things."<br><i>-Anonymous</i></p>
